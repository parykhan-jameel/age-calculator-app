## Overview

### The challenge

- Receive validation errors if:
  - Any field is empty when the form is submitted
  - The day number is not between 1-31
  - The month number is not between 1-12
  - The year is in the future
  - The date is invalid e.g. 31/04/1991 (there are 30 days in April)

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- Tailwind CSS - CSS framework


### What I learned

In this challenge, I learned how to apply react spring to animate the age numbers. React spring provides a simple way to animate things.
### Continued development
I will be doing other challenges using different technologies such as next.js and styled component, so I can leverage my skills.
I would like to continue learning more about React hooks and how they can be used effectively.additionally I would like to explore more about other frameworks and libraries.
